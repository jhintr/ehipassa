    此文译自菩提比丘为中部的英译本而作的序言，我觉得很可以作为一部佛教入门书来看，故不揣简陋，迻译以飨同好。

#### 作为文集的中部

中部是巴利经典中经藏的第二部文集。其标题的字面意思是中等的文集，因为它所包含的经通常是中等长度，排列于其前的长部中的经更长，而排列于其后的相应部及增支部中的经则更短。

中部包含 152 经，分为三个「五十集」，虽然最后一集实际上包含 52 经。每一集中的 10 经进一步合为章或「品」，最后第二品包含 12 经。这些品的名称通常来自其开头一经（或在某些地方，一对经）的标题，所以极少关涉到这些品本身的内容。部分的例外是「中五十集」，品的标题通常表示经中对话者的主要类型，或关键人物。即便如此，标题与内容的关联有时也是薄弱的。整个分类的体系似乎更多是为了方便，而不是同一品经中主题内容的基本同质性。

经的排列也没有特别的教学次第，没有思想的开展演变。所以，虽然不同的经会彼此阐明，且一经的理念仅能由另一经得以填补，而实际上任何经都可以作单独的研究，并获得自足的理解。当然，对整部文集的研究自然会获得最丰富的领会。

如果要用一句话来区别中部与其它巴利经典的话，也许可以将其描述为这样一部文集，即将最丰富的语境设置与最深入、最全面的教学类型结合在一起。与长部类似，中部充满了戏剧性与叙事性，而缺少前者想象的装饰与丰富的传奇。与相应部类似，它包含了一些经典中最深刻的谈话，揭示了佛陀对于存在本质的根本洞见，且与增支部类似，它涵盖了广泛的实用性的主题，然而相较于这两部尼迦耶，中部并不是以简短、独立的表达来介绍其素材，而是在一系列引人入胜的场景中显示佛陀的智慧，其根据对话者的需要与倾向来调整其教法的技巧 ，其智慧与温柔的幽默，其雄伟的崇高精神，及其慈悲的人性。

自然，中部里面绝大多数的谈话是针对比丘的，因为他们与生活在大师周围，并随其出家以承担完整的修学。但在中部里，佛陀不仅仅以僧团领袖的身份与我们相遇。我们一再看到他与古代印度社会中诸多不同阶层的人们进行生动的对话——与国王和王子，与婆罗门和苦行者，与朴素的村民和博学的哲人，与热切的求法者和虚妄的辩论者。也许较于所有其它文本，在这部文本中佛陀以经典里礼敬世尊的偈颂中的「无上士、调御丈夫、天人师」的身份出现。

在中部里，不仅只有佛陀以老师的身份出场。

It is not the Buddha alone who appears in the Majjhima in the role of teacher. The work also introduces us to the accomplished disciples he produced who carried on the transmission of his teaching. Of the 152 suttas in the collection, nine are spoken by the venerable S›riputta, the General of the Dhamma; three of these (MN 9, MN 28, MN 141) have become basic texts for the study of Buddhist doctrine in monastic schools throughout the Therav›da Buddhist world. The venerable finanda, the Buddha’s personal attendant during the last twenty-five years of his life, delivers seven suttas and participates in many more. Four suttas are spoken by the venerable Mah› Kacc›na, who excelled in elaborating upon the brief but enigmatic sayings of the Master, and two by the second chief disciple, the venerable Mah› Moggall›na, one of which (MN 15) has been recommended for a monk’s daily reflections. A dialogue between the venerable S›riputta and the venerable Pu ̊ ̊a Mant› ̊iputta (MN 24) explores a scheme of seven stages of purification that was to form the outline for ficariya Buddhaghosa’s great treatise on the Buddhist path, the Visuddhimagga. Another dialogue (MN 44) introduces the bhikkhunı Dhammadinn›, whose replies to a series of probing questions were so adroit that the Buddha sealed them for posterity with the words “I would have explained it to you in the same way.”

The formats of the suttas are also highly variegated. The majority take the form of discourses proper, expositions of the teaching that pour forth uninterrupted from the mouth of the Enlightened One. A few among these are delivered in a series of unadorned instructional propositions or guidelines to practice, but most are interlaced with striking similes and parables, which flash through and light up the dense mass of doctrine in ways that impress it deeply upon the mind. Other suttas unfold in dialogue and discussion, and in some the dramatic or narra- tive element predominates. Perhaps the best known and most widely appreciated among these is the Angulim›la Sutta (MN 86), which relates how the Buddha subdued the notorious bandit Angulim›la and transformed him into an enlightened saint. Equally moving, though in a different way, is the story of Ra ̨ ̨hap›la (MN 82), the youth of wealthy family whose preco- cious insight into the universality of suffering was so compelling that he was prepared to die rather than accept his parents’ refusal to permit him to go forth into homelessness. Several suttas centre upon debate, and these highlight the Buddha’s wit and delicate sense of irony as well as his dialectical skills. Particular mention might be made of MN 35 and MN 56, with their subtle humour leavening the seriousness of their contents. In a class of its own is the Brahmanimantanika Sutta (MN 49), in which the Buddha visits the Brahma-world to detach a deluded deity from his illusions of grandeur and soon finds himself locked in a gripping contest with M›ra the Evil One—an inconceiv- able alliance of Divinity and Devil defending the sanctity of being against the Buddha’s call for deliverance into Nibb›na, the cessation of being.
