    此文译自菩提比丘为中部的英译本而作的导论，数年前曾匆匆读过，觉得很可以介绍给欲了解佛教的友人。日下有暇，故不揣简陋，迻译以飨同好。

#### 作为文集的中部

中部是巴利经典中经藏的第二部文集。标题的字面意思是中等的文集，因为它所包含的经通常是中等长度，排列于其前的长部中的经更长，而排列于其后的相应部及增支部中的经则更短。

中部包含 152 经，分为三个「五十集」，虽然最后一集实际上包含 52 经。每一集中的 10 经进一步合为章或「品」，最后第二品包含 12 经。这些品的名称通常来自其开头一经（或在某些地方，一对经）的标题，所以极少关涉到这些品本身的内容。部分的例外是「中五十集」，品的标题通常表示经中对话者的主要类型，或关键人物。即便如此，标题与内容有时也极少相关。整个分类的体系似乎更多是为了便利而设置的，而不是表明同一品中各经主题内容的同质。

经的排列也没有特别的教学次第，没有思想的开展演变。所以，虽然不同的经会彼此阐明，且一经的理念需要由另一经得以补充完整，但实际上任何经都可以作单独的研究，并获得自足的理解。当然，对整部文集的研究自然会获得最丰富的领会。

如果要用一句话来区别中部与其它巴利经典的话，也许可以将其描述为这样一部文集，即将最丰富的语境与最深入、最全面的教学结合在一起。与长部类似，中部充满了戏剧性与叙事性，而缺少前者想象的装饰与丰富的传奇。与相应部类似，它包含了一些经典中最深刻的谈话，揭示了佛陀对于存在本质的根本洞见，且与增支部类似，它涵盖了广泛的实用性的主题，然而相较于这两部尼迦耶，中部并不是简短、独立地表述其素材，而是在一系列引人入胜的场景中显示佛陀的智慧，其根据对话者的需要与倾向来调整其教法的技巧，其智慧与温柔的幽默，其雄伟的崇高精神，及其慈悲的人性。

自然，中部里绝大多数的谈话是针对比丘的，因为他们生活在大师周围，并随其出家以从事完整的修学。但在中部里，佛陀不仅仅以僧团领袖的身份与我们相遇。我们一再看到他与古代印度社会中诸多不同阶层的人们进行生动的对话——与国王和王子，与婆罗门和苦行者，与朴素的村民和博学的哲人，与热切的求法者和虚妄的辩论者。也许较于所有其它文本，在这部文本内佛陀更多地以经典中礼敬世尊的偈颂里的「无上士、调御丈夫、天人师」的身份出现。

在中部里，以老师身份出场的不止有佛陀。作品还向我们引介了由他培养的有成就的弘扬其教法的弟子们。文集 152 经中，9 经由法将舍利弗尊者宣说，其中 3 经（`MN9, MN28, MN141`）成为上座部僧伽学校内学习教理的基础课文。阿难尊者，佛陀最后廿五年生命里的侍者，宣讲了 7 经，而参与的则更多。长于广说大师简短而难解的教法的大迦旃延尊者说了 4 经，而第二个上首弟子大目揵连尊者说了 2 经，其中之一（`MN15`）常用于比丘的日常省思。舍利弗尊者和满慈子尊者的对话（`MN24`）探索了七阶段清净的体系，成为觉音阿阇黎论佛教修学的巨著「清净道论」的大纲。另一对话（`MN44`）引介了比丘尼 Dhammadinnā，她对一系列探究性问题的回答如此精巧，以至于佛陀用「我本会以同样的方式向你解释」的言辞将其付与后人。

经的形式也丰富多样。多数采取普通的对话形式，从世尊的口中无间断地涌出对教义的阐述。其中一些是通过一系列朴素的关于教义的陈述或对实修的指导表达的，但大多数都与警人的譬喻和寓言交织在一起，以让人铭记的方式闪现并照亮了深奥的教理。其它的经以对话和讨论展开，有些以戏剧性或叙事性元素占主导。其中最知名且最受称赏的也许是「指鬘经」（`MN86`），它讲述了佛陀是如何折服恶名昭彰的大盗指鬘，并将其转化为觉悟的圣者。同样感人，但以一种不同的方式的，是车护的故事（`MN82`），这个家境富有的年轻人对苦的普遍性的早熟洞见是如此强烈，以至于他宁可准备赴死，也不接受父母拒绝让他出家。有些经专注于辩论，这些经突显了佛陀的机智和微妙的讽刺感，以及他的辩证技巧。需要特别提及的是 `MN35` 和 `MN56`，以其微妙的幽默平衡了其内容的严肃。自成一类的是 Brahmanimantanika 经（`MN49`），佛陀在其中到访梵天界，以使一个遭受蒙骗的天人摆脱对宏伟幻想的执著，并很快发现自己陷入了与魔罗的激烈竞争中，邪恶者魔罗是一个不可思议的天与魔的联盟，他捍卫存在的神圣性，反对佛陀对解脱涅槃——存在的止息——的召唤。


#### 中部里的佛陀

Biographical information for its own sake was never an overriding concern of the redactors of the Pali Canon, and thus the data the Majjhima provides on the life of the Buddha is scanty and uncoordinated, included principally because of the light it sheds on the Buddha as the ideal exemplar of the spiritual quest and the fully qualified teacher. Nevertheless, though it subordinates biography to other concerns, the Majjhima does give us the fullest canonical account of the Master’s early life as a Bodhisatta, a seeker of enlightenment. With the Dıgha it shares the miraculous story of his conception and birth (MN 123), but its version of his great renunciation has been stripped to bare essentials and related in the stark terms of existential realism. In his youth, having seen through the sensual delights to which his princely status entitled him (MN 75.10), the Bodhisatta decided that it was futile to pursue things subject like himself to ageing and death and thus, with his parents weeping, he left the home life and went in search of the ageless and deathless, Nibb›na (MN 26.13). MN 26 tells of his discipleship under two accomplished meditation teachers of the day, his mastery of their systems, and his consequent disillusionment. MN 12 and MN 36 describe his ascetic practices during his six hard years of striving, a path he pursued almost to the point of death. MN 26 and MN 36 both relate in lean and unembellished terms his attainment of enlightenment, which they view from different angles, while MN 26 takes us past the enlightenment to the decision to teach and the instruction of his first disciples. From that point on connected biography breaks off in the Majjhima and can only be reconstructed partially and hypothetically.

Again, despite the absence of any systematic account, the Majjhima offers a sufficient number of cameo portraits of the Buddha for us to obtain, with the aid of information provided by other sources, a fairly satisfactory picture of his daily activities and annual routine during the forty-five years of his ministry. A commentarial text shows the Buddha’s daily schedule as having been divided between periods of instructing the bhikkhus, giving discourses to the laity, and secluded meditation, during which he usually dwelt either in the “abode of voidness” (MN 121.3, MN 122.6) or in the attainment of great compassion. The day’s single meal was always taken in the forenoon, either received by invitation or collected on almsround, and his sleep was restricted to a few hours per night, except in the summer, when he rested briefly during the middle of the day (MN 36.46). The annual routine was determined by the Indian climate, which divided the year into three seasons— a cold season from November through February, a hot season from March through June, and a rainy season from July through October. As was customary among the ascetics of ancient India, the Buddha and his monastic community would remain at a fixed residence during the rainy season, when torrential rains and swollen rivers made travel almost impossible. During the rest of the year he would wander through the Ganges Valley expounding his teachings to all who were prepared to listen.

The Buddha’s main seats of residence for the rains retreat (vassa) were located at S›vatthı in the state of Kosala and R›jagaha in the state of Magadha. At S›vatthı he would usually stay at Jeta’s Grove, a park offered to him by the wealthy merchant An›thapi ̊ ̃ika, and accordingly a great number of Majjhima discourses are recorded as having been given there. Occasionally at S›vatthı he would reside instead at the Eastern Park, offered by the devout lay-woman Vis›kh›, also known as “Mig›ra’s mother.” In R›jagaha he often stayed at the Bamboo Grove, offered by the king of Magadha, Seniya Bimbis›ra, or for greater seclusion, on Vulture Peak outside the city. His wanderings, during which he was usually accompanied by a large retinue of bhikkhus, ranged from the Angan country (close to modern West Bengal) to the Himalayan foothills and the Kuru country (modern Delhi). Occasionally, when he saw that a special case required his individual attention, he would leave the Sangha and travel alone (see MN 75, MN 86, MN 140).

Although the Canon is precise and reliable in affording such details, for the early Buddhist community interest focuses upon the Buddha not so much in his concrete historical particularity as in his archetypal significance. Whereas outsiders might view him as merely one among the many spiritual teachers of the day—as “the recluse Gotama”—to his disciples “he is vision, he is knowledge, he is the Dhamma, he is the holy one,...the giver of the Deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tath›gata” (MN 18.12). The last term in this series is the epithet the Buddha uses most often when referring to himself and it underscores his significance as the Great Arrival who brings to fulfilment a cosmic, repetitive pattern of events. The Pali commentators explain the word as meaning “thus come” (tath› ›gata) and “thus gone” (tath› gata), that is, the one who comes into our midst bearing the message of deathlessness to which he has gone by his own practice of the path. As the Tath›gata he possesses the ten powers of knowledge and the four intrepidities, which enable him to roar his “lion’s roar” in the assemblies (MN 12.9–20). He is not merely a wise sage or a benevolent moralist but the latest in the line of Fully Enlightened Ones, each of whom arises singly in an age of spiritual darkness, discovers the deepest truths about the nature of existence, and establishes a Dispensation (s›sana) through which the path to deliverance again becomes accessible to the world. Even those of his disciples who have attained unsurpassable vision, practice, and deliverance still honour and venerate the Tath›gata as one who, enlightened himself, teaches others for the sake of their enlightenment (MN 35.26). Looking back at him following his demise, the first generation of monks could say: “The Blessed One was the arouser of the unarisen path, the producer of the unproduced path, the declarer of the undeclared path; he was the knower of the path, the finder of the path, the one skilled in the path,” which is followed by and attained to afterwards by his disciples (MN 108.5).
