### Lesson 1 Alphabet

| Other dialect | Works     |
|:--------------|:----------|
| Epic          | Homer     |
| Ionic         | Herodotus |
| Doric         | choral songs in Attic tragedies |
| Aeolic        | Sappho    |


In 403 BCE, the Athenians adopted the more precise alphabet used by speakers of the Ionic dialect, a close relative of Attic.

Of the 24 letters, the first 19 were adapted from letters in the Phoenician alphabet and thus have Semitic names, the last 5 were invented by the Greeks.

| name    | capital | cursive | name    | capital | cursive |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| ἄλφα    | **Α**   | **α**   | νῦ      | **Ν**   | **ν**   |
| βῆτα    | **Β**   | **β**   | ξῖ      | **Ξ**   | **ξ**   |
| γάμμα   | **Γ**   | **γ**   | ὂμῑκρόν | **Ο**   | **ο**   |
| δέλτα   | **Δ**   | **δ**   | πῖ      | **Π**   | **π**   |
| ἒψῑλόν  | **Ε**   | **ε**   | ῥῶ      | **Ρ**   | **ρ**   |
| ζῆτα    | **Ζ**   | **ζ**   | σίγμα   | **Σ**   | **σ ς** |
| ἦτα     | **Η**   | **η**   | ταῦ     | **Τ**   | **τ**   |
| θῆτα    | **Θ**   | **θ**   | ὖψῑλόν  | **Υ**   | **υ**   |
| ἰῶτα    | **Ι**   | **ι**   | φῖ      | **Φ**   | **φ**   |
| κάππα   | **Κ**   | **κ**   | χῖ      | **Χ**   | **χ**   |
| λάμβδα  | **Λ**   | **λ**   | ψῖ      | **Ψ**   | **ψ**   |
| μῦ      | **Μ**   | **μ**   | ὦμέγα   | **Ω**   | **ω**   |

**Diphthongs**

| ending in Ι | ending in Υ | ending in Ι | ending in Υ |
|:------------|:------------|:------------|:------------|
| ΑΙ αι       | ΑΥ αυ       | ᾹΙ ᾳ        |             |
| ΕΙ ει       | ΕΥ ευ       | ΗΙ ῃ        | ΗΥ ηυ       |
| ΟΙ οι       | ΟΥ ου       | ΩΙ ῳ        |             |
| ΥΙ υι       |             |             |             |

- **γ** = nasalized *n* before **γ**, **κ**, **χ**, **ξ**, (**μ**)
- During the Classical period the letter **ο**, **ω**, **ε**, **υ** had the names οὖ, ὦ, εἶ, and ὖ. The expanded names they now have (meaning "small o", "big o", "plain e", and "plain u") were created by grammarians in the Byzantine age.
- Breathings. A word with an initial upsilon will always have rough breathing (e.g., **ὑ- υἱ-**).

**Consonants**

- If one stop is followed by a different stop or a liquid or a nasal, they are usually pronounced together.
- If one liquid or nasal is followed by a different liquid or nasal or by a stop, they are pronounced separately (**μν** is an exception).
- Repeated consonants are also always pronounced separately, as are the two sounds in a double consonant.
- When a sigma is followed by a different consonant, the pronunciation is ambiguous.



### Lesson 2 Accents

The *acute* can appear on the antepenult, penult, or the ultima. The *circumflex* can appear on the penult or the ultima. The *grave* appears only on the ultima: if a word that would have had an acute on its last syllable is followed directly by another word, with no intervening punctuation mark, the acute switches to a grave, otherwise the acute remains unchanged.

**Principle 1**: The acute can stay on the antepenult only if the ultima is short *(i.e., if it has a short vowel not followed by a double consonant, or if it ends in -αι or -οι)*. If the ultima is long by nature or position, the acute must move to the penult.

**Principle 2**: If the penult is naturally long and the ultima has a short vowel or ends in -αι or -οι, the accent on the penult will be a circumflex, otherwise will be an acute.



### Lesson 3 Ω-Verbs present active indicative, infinitive, imperative

**Voice**: verbs with middle voice if the subject performs an action for itself or on someone or something of special interest to it.

**Mood**: a Greek verb has one of four possible moods: indicative, imperative, subjunctive, or opatative.

**Aspect** is the type or quality of the action, as perceived by the speaker:

- Imperfective: as a process continuing or repeated over time.
- Aoristic: as a one-time occurrence, neither continuing nor completed.
- Perfective: as completed and having an enduring result.

The *imperative, subjunctive, and optative* moods use tense to show aspect:

- *present* tense: imperfective aspect
- *aorist* tense: aoristic aspect
- *perfect* tense: perfective aspect

while the *indicative* mood uses tense to show not only aspect but also time, there are 4 primary and 3 secondary tenses:

- ***present*** tense: present time, imperfective or aoristic aspect
- *perfect* tense: present time, perfective aspect
- *imperfect* tense: past time, imperfective aspect
- *aorist* tense: past time, aoristic aspect
- *pluperfect* tense: past time, perfective aspect
- ***future*** tense: future time, imperfective or aoristic aspect
- *future perfect* tense: future time, perfective aspect

#### Present Active Indicative

|         | singular      | plural            |
|:--------|:--------------|:------------------|
| 1st     | παιδεύ**ω**   | παιδεύ**ομεν**    |
| 2nd     | παιδεύ**εις** | παιδεύ**ετε**     |
| 3rd     | παιδεύ**ει**  | παιδεύ**ουσι(ν)** |

**Movable ν** is added whenever the following word begins with a vowel or it falls at the end of a sentence.

**Recessive Accent**. The accent of most finite forms is recessive, i.e., it wants to move as far to the left in the word as possible.

#### Present Active Infinitive

παιδεύ**ειν**: normally, the tense shows only aspect, not time.

#### Present Active Imperative

|         | singular      | plural            |
|:--------|:--------------|:------------------|
| 2nd     | παίδευ**ε**   | παιδεύ**ετε**     |
| 3rd     | παιδευ**έτω** | παιδευ**όντων**   |

```
γράφω         write, draw
ἐθέλω         be willing (to), wish (to)
θύω           offer sacrifice, sacrifice, slay
κλέπτω        steal
παιδεύω       teach, educate
σπεύδω        hasten (to), strive (to), be eager (to)
φυλάττω       stand guard, protect, preserve

μή            not
οὐ            not
καί           and, also, even
καὶ...καί     both...and
```

- **οὐ** is a **proclitic**, a type of word that has no accent of its own, there are 10 such words in Greek.
- **οὐ** is unique in that it does receive an accent if it comes at the end of a clause **οὔ**.
- Before a smooth breathing it becomes **οὐκ**, before a rough breathing it becomes **οὐχ**.



### Lesson 4 First Declension feminine nouns part 1

The Genitive also functions as a substitute for Indo-European's ablative case, and the dative case for instrumental and locative cases.

First-declension nouns can be divided into two groups: feminines and masculines. Originally all first-declension feminine nouns had stems ending in **-ᾱ**, this remained so in the Doric and Aeolic dialects. In Attic, however, **-ᾱ** was replaced by **-η** in all cases of the *singular*, except preceded by **ε**, **ι**, or **ρ**.

#### First-Declension Feminine Nouns: ᾱ-stems, η-stems, definite article

|       | singular |            | plural     | ar. sg.  | ar. pl.  |
|:------|:---------|:-----------|:-----------|:---------|:---------|
| nom.  | θε**ά**  | σκην**ή**  | θε**αί**   | **ἡ**    | **αἱ**   |
| gen.  | θε**ᾶς** | σκην**ῆς** | θε**ῶν**   | **τῆς**  | **τῶν**  |
| dat.  | θε**ᾷ**  | σκην**ῇ**  | θε**αῖς**  | **τῇ**   | **ταῖς** |
| acc.  | θε**άν** | σκην**ήν** | θε**άς**   | **τήν**  | **τάς**  |
| voc.  | θε**ά**  | σκην**ή**  | θε**αί**   |          |          |

**Persistent Accent**. The location of the accent in the nom. sg. shows where the accent wants to stay or "persist".

The accent of first-declension feminine:

1. If the accent falls on the ultima in the gen. and dat., sg. and pl., it changes from acute to circumflex.
1. In the gen. pl., the syllable that receives the accent is always the ultima.

```
πέμπω               send

ἀγορά, -ᾶς, ἡ       marketplace
ἐπιστολή, -ῆς, ἡ    letter, message
ἡσυχίᾱ, -ᾱς, ἡ      leisure, stillness, tranquility
θεά, -ᾶς, ἡ         goddess
σκηνή, -ῆς, ἡ       tent
χώρᾱ, -ᾱς, ἡ        land, country, space, position

εἰς                 (prep.) into, to [acc.]
ἐκ (ἐξ)             (prep.) out of [gen.]
ἐν                  (prep.) in [dat.]
ὦ                   O!
```

- **ἐξ** is used before words starting with a vowel.
- **οὐκ**, **οὐχ**, **ἐκ** are exceptions violating the rule that a Greek word can end only in a vowel, **ν**, **ρ**, **ς**, **ξ** or **ψ**. There are no other exceptions to the rule.



### Lesson 5 First Declension feminine nouns part 2

In the Attic dialect *a short alpha* was allowed to creep into the nom., acc., and voc. sg. endings of some ᾱ-stem and η-stem nouns.

#### First-Declension Feminine Nouns: α/ᾱς & α/ης Subcategories

|       | singular   |              | plural       |
|:------|:-----------|:-------------|:-------------|
| nom.  | μοῖρ**α**  | θάλαττ**α**  | μοῖρ**αι**   |
| gen.  | μοίρ**ᾱς** | θαλάττ**ης** | μοιρ**ῶν**   |
| dat.  | μοίρ**ᾳ**  | θαλάττ**ῃ**  | μοίρ**αις**  |
| acc.  | μοῖρ**αν** | θάλαττ**αν** | μοίρ**ᾱς**   |
| voc.  | μοῖρ**α**  | θάλαττ**α**  | μοῖρ**αι**   |

**Reflexive Use of the Definite Article**: The definite article is often used in a reflexive sense to indicate someone or something that belongs to the subject, has some relation to it, or is a physical part of it.

```
ἀκούω                 hear, listen, listen to [gen. acc.]
βλάπτω                harm, hurt
κελεύω                order (to), command (to), urge (to) [acc. dat.]

δέσποινα, -ης, ἡ      mistress, lady
θάλαττα, -ης, ἡ       sea
θεράπαινα, -ης, ἡ     servant, maid
κλίνη, -ης, ἡ         couch, bed
μοῖρα, -ᾱς, ἡ         destiny, fate
ὥρᾱ, -ᾱς, ἡ           season, hour; it is time (to) [acc. dat.]

ἐπεί, ἐπειδή          (conj.) when, after, since, because
```



### Lesson 6 Ω-Verbs future active indicative, infinitive

The future tense of the indicative mood uses the same endings as the present tense, which is actually a combination of a thematic vowel (ε/ο) and a personal ending.

#### Second Principle Part

The future stem is just the present stem + the tense marker **σ**. If the present stem ends in a consonant, the euphonic changes occur:

```
π, β, φ, πτ + σ = ψ
κ, γ, χ, ττ + σ = ξ
τ, δ, θ     + σ = σ
```

Many Greek verbs are irregular in the future tense. The Lexicon will list the 1st sg. active indicative as the verb's *second principle part*.

- **ἀκούω, ἀκούσομαι**: during the Classical age the future tense of ἀκούω always had the endings for middle voice.
- **ἐθέλω, ἐθελήσω**: the future stem is formed by adding both a lengthened thematic vowel (ε becomes η) and a sigma to its present stem.

#### Future Active Infinitive

While, as a rule, Greek infinitive do not indicate time, there are important exceptions.

παιδεύ**σειν**: its accent is always on the penult.

#### Use of μέλλω

The notation (to) in the vocabulary indicates that a present infinitive, an aorist infinitive, or rarely, a perfect infinitive—but not a future infinitive—may be used. The only verb in this book that takes a future infinitive is *μέλλω*.

If it is used alone or is complemented with a present infinitive, it may mean "I delay" or "I hesitate": μὴ μέλλε *don't delay!*.

```
ἀλλάττω, ἀλλάξω     change, alter
διώκω, διώξω        pursue, chase, hunt, drive away, banish
ἔχω, ἕξω/σχήσω      have, hold, process; be able (to)
μέλλω, μελλήσω      be about (to), intend (to)

κόρη, -ης, ἡ        maiden, girl, daughter
οἰκίᾱ, -ᾱς, ἡ       house, household

ἔτι                 (adv.) still, yet, longer
μηκέτι              (adv.) no longer, no more
οὐκέτι              (adv.) no longer, no more
πάλιν               (adv.) back, backwards, again, once more
ἀλλά (ἀλλ')         (conj.) but
```

- **ἀλλάττω** is always transitive.
- **ἕξω** has imperfective aspect, **σχήσω** has aoristic aspect.
- **κόρη** is an exception to the rule that, in Attic, **ᾱ** after **ρ** never changes to **η**.
- A Greek word ending in a short vowel is usually elided when it comes before a word starting with a vowel. These elisions are often taken for granted and left unmarked in manuscripts, but in a few common words that are frequently elided, it is conventional to mark the elision with an apostrophe, **ἀλλά** is one of these words.



### Lesson 7 Second Declension masculine nouns

Nouns in the second-declension can be divided into two groups: masculines and neuters. All second-declension masculines have the same set of endings, there are no variations caused by features of the Attic dialect. The stem-vowel is **ο**.

#### Second-Declension Masculine Nouns

|       | singular     | plural        | ar. sg.  | ar. pl.  |
|:------|:-------------|:--------------|:---------|:---------|
| nom.  | ἄνθρωπ**ος** | ἄνθρωπ**οι**  | **ὁ**    | **οἱ**   |
| gen.  | ἀνθρώπ**ου** | ἀνθρώπ**ων**  | **τοῦ**  | **τῶν**  |
| dat.  | ἀνθρώπ**ῳ**  | ἀνθρώπ**οις** | **τῷ**   | **τοῖς** |
| acc.  | ἄνθρωπ**ον** | ἀνθρώπ**ους** | **τόν**  | **τούς** |
| voc.  | ἄνθρωπ**ε**  | ἄνθρωπ**οι**  |          |          |

The accent is persistent. Unlike first-declension, it does not invariably put a circumflex above the gen. pl. ending, since -ων of first-declension still reflects its origin as a contraction (-άων) while the -ων (-όων) of second-declension does not.

**Gender**. Occasionally a noun will have ο-stem endings but be feminine. Its unusual gender will be shown, not by the form of the word itself, but by the form of the words that modify it (e.g., a definite article or an adj.). Some second-declension nouns are variable in their gender. Such words are called *epicene* and are said to have common gender.

**Dative of Means & Dative of Manner**: see Lesson 4.

```
χαίρω, χαιρήσω          be happy; rejoice in, take delight in [dat.]

ἀδελφή, -ῆς, ἡ          sister
ἀδελφός, -οῦ, ὁ         brother (voc. sg. ἄδελφε has recessive accent)
ἄνθρωπος, -ου, ὁ, ἡ     human being, person, man/woman
θεός, -οῦ, ὁ, ἡ         god/goddess (voc. sg. θεός or θεέ)
ἵππος, -ου, ὁ, ἡ        horse/mare
λίθος, -ου, ὁ           stone
λύπη, -ης, ἡ            pain, grief
ὁδός, -οῦ, ἡ            way, path, road, journey
ποταμός, -οῦ, ὁ         river
χαρά, -ᾶς, ἡ            joy, delight

ἀπό (ἀπ', ἀφ')          (prep.) away from [gen.]
```

- The imperatives **χαῖρε** and **χαίρετε** are used as greeting or parting words: Hello!, Farewell!



### Lesson 8 Second Declension neuter nouns, Adjectives first/second declension

Second-declension neuters are also **ο**-stem nouns.

#### Second-Declension Neuter Nouns

|       | singular  | cf. masc. | plural     | cf. masc. |
|:------|:----------|:----------|:-----------|:----------|
| nom.  | δῶρ**ον** | **ος**    | δῶρ**α**   | **οι**    |
| gen.  | δώρ**ου** |           | δώρ**ων**  |           |
| dat.  | δώρ**ῳ**  |           | δώρ**οις** |           |
| acc.  | δῶρ**ον** |           | δῶρ**α**   | **ους**   |
| voc.  | δῶρ**ον** | **ε**     | δῶρ**α**   | **οι**    |

Every neuter noun in Greek, the nom. acc. and voc. are identical in the singular and plural.

#### Definite Article, All Forms

|          | Masc.    |          | Fem.       |            | Neut.    |          |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:-----------|:-----------|:---------|:---------|
| nom.     | **ὁ**    | **οἱ**   | **ἡ**      | **αἱ**     | **τό**   | **τά**   |
| gen.     | **τοῦ**  | **τῶν**  | **τῆς**    | **τῶν**    | **τοῦ**  | **τῶν**  |
| dat.     | **τῷ**   | **τοῖς** | **τῇ**     | **ταῖς**   | **τῷ**   | **τοῖς** |
| acc.     | **τόν**  | **τούς** | **τήν**    | **τάς**    | **τό**   | **τά**   |

**Plural Subject with Singular Verb**. Most of the time a neuter plural subject is regarded as a single collective unit, requiring a singular verb.

#### Adjectives

There are two types of adjectives in Greek, those with the same endings as first/second-declension nouns and those as third-declension nouns.

|          | Masc.    |          | Fem.       |            | Neut.    |          |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:-----------|:-----------|:---------|:---------|
| nom.     | **ος**   | **οι**   | **ᾱ/η**    | **αι**     | **ον**   | **α**    |
| gen.     | **ου**   | **ων**   | **ᾱς/ης**  | **ων**     | **ου**   | **ων**   |
| dat.     | **ῳ**    | **οις**  | **ᾳ/ῃ**    | **αις**    | **ῳ**    | **οις**  |
| acc.     | **ον**   | **ους**  | **ᾱν/ην**  | **ᾱς**     | **ον**   | **α**    |
| voc.     | **ε**    | **οι**   | **ᾱ/η**    | **αι**     | **ον**   | **α**    |

Greek lexica simply list its three nom. sg. forms in an abbreviated way: ἀγαθός, -ή, -όν.

An **attributive** adjective and its noun together form a noun phrase. A **predicative** adjective differs from an attributive adjective in being part of the verbal idea, works with a linking verb to describe the subject.

**Attributive Position**. In Greek this is just one of three possible positions for the attributive adjective:

- **τὸ ἀγαθὸν** τέκνον: *the good child* (emphasis on the adj.)
- τὸ τέκνον **τὸ ἀγαθόν**: *the child, the good one* (emphasis on the noun)
- τέκνον **τὸ ἀγαθόν**: *a child, the one that's good*

**Predicate Position**. If an adj. does not come after the definite article, the adj. has predicate position.

- τὸ τέκνον **ἀγαθόν**: *The child (is) good.*
- **ἀγαθόν** τὸ τέκνον: changing the word order will affect the emphasis but not the basic meaning.

```
εὑρίσκω, εὑρήσω     find, find out, discover
λείπω, λείψω        leave behind
  ἀπο-              abandon

βίος, -ου, ὁ        life, lifetime, livelihood
δῶρον, -ου, τό      gift
ἔργον, -ου, τό      work, task, occupation, deed
θησαυρός, -οῦ, ὁ    treasure, storehouse
τέκνον, -ου, τό     child, offspring
φυτόν, -οῦ, τό      plant, tree

ἀγαθός, -ή, -όν     good, brave, virtuous
ἄξιος, -ᾱ, -ον      worthy (to), worthy of [gen.], deserving
καλός, -ή, -όν      beautiful, fair, good, noble
```



### Lesson 9 First Declension masculine nouns, Substantives

#### First-Declension Masculine Nouns, ᾱ-stems & η-stems

The sg. of nom., gen., and voc. do not match those of the feminine nouns.

|       | singular    |             | plural       |              |
|:------|:------------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| nom.  | μαθητ**ής** | νεᾱνί**ᾱς** | μαθητ**αί**  | νεᾱνί**αι**  |
| gen.  | μαθητ**οῦ** | νεᾱνί**ου** | μαθητ**ῶν**  | νεᾱνι**ῶν**  |
| dat.  | μαθητ**ῇ**  | νεᾱνί**ᾳ**  | μαθητ**αῖς** | νεᾱνί**αις** |
| acc.  | μαθητ**ήν** | νεᾱνί**ᾱν** | μαθητ**άς**  | νεᾱνί**ᾱς**  |
| voc.  | μαθητ**ά**  | νεᾱνί**ᾱ**  | μαθητ**αί**  | νεᾱνί**αι**  |

- The voc. sg. of ᾱ-stems always ends in a long alpha.
- The voc. sg. of η-stems ends in a short alpha if the nom. ends in -της or the word is a compound, otherwise the voc. ends in -η.

**-της** word identifies the agent or the doer of an action, or a person concerned with or involved in something.

**Two-ending adj.** use masculine endings to modify both masculine and feminine nouns. Many such adj. are compounds of **ά/άν** and a stem.

**Substantives**. If a noun is omitted, the adj. modifying it becomes what is called a substantive.

**Prepositional Phrases** is naturally adverbial, it can also act as an adj. or even as a noun.

- οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ θύουσιν. *The people are sacrificing in the tent.*
- οἱ ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ ἄνθρωποι θύουσιν. *The people in the tent are sacrificing.*
- οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ θύουσιν.
- οἱ ἐν τῇ σκηνῇ θύουσιν.

In the first sentence, the prep. phrase functions as an adv.. In the second and third sentences it has attributive position and forms part of a noun phrase. In the last sentence, the prep. phrase and the article together form a substantive.

In the last three sentences, a negative adv. could be inserted between the article and the prep. phrase.

**Genitive of Possession**. e.g., *the master's house* :

- ἡ οἰκίᾱ τοῦ δεσπότου
- τοῦ δεσπότου ἡ οἰκίᾱ

You can also place the gen. of possession in the attributive position:

- ἡ τοῦ δεσπότου οἰκίᾱ
- ἡ οἰκίᾱ ἡ τοῦ δεσπότου

```
δουλεύω, δουλεύσω       be a slave (to), serve [dat.]

δεσπότης, -ου, ὁ        master, lord, despot (voc. sg. δέσποτα)
μαθητής, -οῦ, ὁ         student, disciple
νεᾱνίᾱς, -ου, ὁ         young man, a youth
οἰκέτης, -ου, ὁ         servant, family member

### Lesson 10 Ω-Verbs imperfect active indicative, Correlatives

The imperfect tense is built on the present stem, and it has an augment and secondary endings.

**Augment**. If the present stem begins with a consonant, **ἐ-/ἐρ-** is prefixed to it, which is called *syllabic* augment. If the present stem begins with a vowel or a diphthong, the vowel or diphthong is lengthened, which is called *temporal* augment.

```
α/ε   > η,      ᾳ > ῃ,      ο  > ω
αι/ει > ῃ,      ι > ῑ,      οι > ῳ
αυ/ευ > ηυ,     υ > ῡ,      ου > ου
```

In compound verbs the augment usually comes between the prefix and the stem. The last letter of the prefix, if it is a vowel, generally drops out, e.g., ἀπολείπω > ἀπέλειπον.

#### Imperfect Active Indicative

|         | singular        | plural          |
|:--------|:----------------|:----------------|
| 1st     | ἐπαίδευ**ον**   | ἐπαιδεύ**ομεν** |
| 2nd     | ἐπαίδευ**ες**   | ἐπαιδεύ**ετε**  |
| 3rd     | ἐπαίδευ**ε(ν)** | ἐπαίδευ**ον**   |

Exceptions:

- **ἔχω** > εἶχον
- **εὑρίσκω** > εὕρισκον or ηὕρισκον

#### Correlatives

Among the most popular correlatives in Greek are **μέν...δέ**. Both are **postpositives**, i.e., they like to come right after the first word. If the second clause begins with οὐ or μή, make δέ the third word in that clause to avoid the confusion with οὐδέ and μεδέ.

```
λέγω, ἐρῶ/λέξω      say, speak, tell
πράττω, πράξω       do, act
φεύγω, φεύξομαι     flee, avoid, escape, be in exile

ἀλήθεια, -ᾱς, ἡ     truth
  ἀληθείᾳ           truly, really
θάνατος, -ου, ὁ     death
κίνδῡνος, -ου, ὁ    danger, risk

φίλος, -η, -ον      dear (to) [dat.]

δέ (δ')             and, but
μέν                 indeed
μέν...δέ            on the one hand...on the other hand
ὁ μέν...ὁ δέ        this one...that one
οὖν                 therefore, then
```
