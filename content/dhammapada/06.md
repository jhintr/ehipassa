##### 76

Nidhīnaṃ va pavattāraṃ, yaṃ passe vajjadassinaṃ, niggayhavādiṃ medhāviṃ, tādisaṃ paṇḍitaṃ bhaje, tādisaṃ bhajamānassa, seyyo hoti na pāpiyo.

- 若見彼智者，能指示過失，並能譴責者，當與彼為友，猶如知識者，能指示寶藏，與彼智人友，定善而無惡。
- If one should see one who sees faults and speaks rebukingly, wise, one should follow such a learned man as one would the reporter of treasures. For one following such a one it becomes better, not worse.

Ovadeyyānusāseyya, asabbhā ca nivāraye, satañhi so piyo hoti, asataṃ hoti appiyo.

- 訓誡與教示，阻他人過惡，善人愛此人，但為惡人憎。
- He would advise, he would admonish, he would restrain from the impure. He becomes beloved of the good, he becomes unbeloved of the bad.

##### 78

- 莫與惡友交，莫友卑鄙者，應與善友交，應友高尚士。
- One should not associate with evil friends, one should not associate with the lowest of men. One should associate with good friends, one should associate with the best of men.

- 得飲法水者，心清而安樂，智者常喜悅，聖者所說法。

- 灌溉者引水，箭匠之矯箭，木匠之繩木，智者自調禦。
- Truly canal-makers lead water, fletchers bend the arrow (straight), carpenters bend wood, learned men tame the self.

##### 81

Selo yathā ekaghano, vātena na samīrati, evaṃ nindāpasaṃsāsu, na samiñjanti paṇḍitā.

- 猶如堅固岩，不為風所搖，毀謗與贊譽，智者不為動。
- As a solid rock is not moved by the wind, so learned men are not moved amid praise and blame.

##### 82

Yathā pi rahado gambhīro, vippasanno anāvilo, evaṃ dhammāni sutvāna, vippasīdanti paṇḍitā.

- 亦如一深池，清明而澄淨，智者聞法已，如是心清淨。
- Just as a deep pool is calm and clear, so, hearing the teachings, learned men are calm.

##### 83

Sabbattha ve sappurisā cajanti, na kāmakāmā lapayanti santo, sukhena phuṭṭhā atha vā dukhena, na uccāvacaṃ paṇḍitā dassayanti.

- 善人離諸欲，不論諸欲事，苦樂所不動，智者無喜憂。
- Good men indeed go everywhere. The good do not boast from desire for sensual pleasures. Touched by happiness or misery, learned men do not show variation.

Na attahetu na parassa hetu, na puttam-icche na dhanaṃ na raṭṭhaṃ, na iccheyya adhammena samiddhim-attano, sa sīlavā paññavā dhammiko siyā.

- 不因自因他，智者作諸惡，不求子求財，及謀國作惡，不欲以非法，求自己繁榮，彼實具戒行，智慧正法者。
- Who neither for his own sake nor for the sake of another would wish for a son, or wealth, or a kingdom, nor would wish prosperity for himself by unlawful means, he would be virtuous, wise and lawful.

- 於此人群中，達彼岸者少，其餘諸人等，徘徊於此岸。
- Few are those persons among men who go to the far shore. But those other people only run along the bank.

##### 86

Ye ca kho sammadakkhāte, dhamme dhammānuvattino, te janā pāram-essanti, maccudheyyaṃ suduttaraṃ.

- 善能說法者，及依正法行，彼能達彼岸，度難度魔境。
- But those people, who, when the doctrine has been properly preached, follow the doctrine, will go to the far shore. The dominion of death is very hard to cross over.
