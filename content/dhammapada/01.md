Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā, manoseṭṭhā manomayā, manasā ce paduṭṭhena, bhāsati vā karoti vā, tato naṃ dukkham-anveti, cakkaṃ va vahato padaṃ.

- 諸法意先導，意主意造作，若以染汙意，或語或行業，是則苦隨彼，如輪隨獸足。
- *Mental phenomena are preceded by mind, have mind as their leader, are made by mind. If one acts or speaks with an evil mind, from that sorrow follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox.*

Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā, manoseṭṭhā manomayā, manasā ce pasannena, bhāsati vā karoti vā, tato naṃ sukham-anveti, chāyā va anapāyinī.

- 諸法意先導，意主意造作，若以清淨意，或語或行業，是則樂隨彼，如影不離形。
- *Mental phenomena are preceded by mind, have mind as their leader, are made by mind. If one acts or speaks with a pure mind, from that happiness follows him, like a shadow not going away.*

- 「彼罵我打我，敗我劫奪我」，若人捨此念，怨恨自平息。

Na hi verena verāni, sammantīdha kudācanaṃ, averena ca sammanti, esa dhammo sanantano.

- 於此世界中，從非怨止怨，唯以忍止怨，此古聖常法。
- *For not by hatred are hatreds ever quenched here, but they are quenched by non-hatred. This is the ancient rule.*

Pare ca na vijānanti, “mayam-ettha yamāmase”, ye ca tattha vijānanti, tato sammanti medhagā.

- *Contemplating unpleasant things, living well controlled in his senses, and knowing moderation in eating, having faith, putting forth energy, him indeed Māra does not overcome, as the wind does not overcome a rocky mountain.*
