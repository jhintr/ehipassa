##### 235

Paṇḍupalāso va dānisi, yamapurisā pi ca te upaṭṭhitā, uyyogamukhe ca tiṭṭhasi, pātheyyam pi ca te na vijjati.

- 汝今已似枯燋葉，閻魔使者近身邊，汝已佇立死門前，旅途汝亦無資糧。
- You are now like a yellow leaf, and Yama's men too stand near you. You stand at the beginning of an undertaking, and you do not even have provisions for the journey.

##### 236

So karohi dīpam-attano, khippaṃ vāyama paṇḍito bhava, niddhantamalo anaṅgaṇo, dibbaṃ ariyabhūmiṃ upehisi.

- 汝宜自造安全洲，迅速精勤為智者，拂除塵垢無煩惱，得達諸天之聖境。
- Make an island for yourself, strive quickly, be learned. With impurity blown away, without blemish, you will go to the heavenly land of the noble ones.

##### 237

Upanītavayo ca dānisi, sampayātosi yamassa santike, vāso te natthi antarā, pātheyyam pi ca te na vijjati.

- 汝今壽命行已終，汝已移步近閻魔，道中既無停息處，旅途汝亦無資糧。
- You are now advanced in age indeed. You have come to the presence of Yama. There is not even a stopping place for you in between, and you do not even have provisions for the journey.

So karohi dīpam-attano, khippaṃ vāyama paṇḍito bhava, niddhantamalo anaṅgaṇo, na punaṃ jātijaraṃ upehisi.

- 汝宜自造安全洲，迅速精勤為智者，拂除塵垢無煩惱，不復重來生與老。
- Make an island for yourself, strive quickly, be learned. With impurity blown away, without blemish, you will not come again to birth and old age.

Anupubbena medhāvī, thokaṃ thokaṃ khaṇe khaṇe, kammāro rajatasseva, niddhame malam-attano.

- 剎那剎那間，智者分分除，漸拂自垢穢，如冶工鍛金。
- A wise man would blow away his own impurity, gradually, little by little, at every opportunity, as a smith blows away the impurity of silver.

##### 240

Ayasā va malaṃ samuṭṭhitaṃ, tad-uṭṭhāya tam-eva khādati, evaṃ atidhonacārinaṃ, sāni kammāni nayanti duggatiṃ.

- 如鐵自生銹，生已自腐蝕，犯罪者亦爾，自業導惡趣。
- Just as the impurity arising from iron, rising from it eats that very thing, in the same way his own deeds lead one excessively devoted to ascetic practices to a bad rebirth.

##### 241

Asajjhāyamalā mantā, anuṭṭhānamalā gharā, malaṃ vaṇṇassa kosajjaṃ, pamādo rakkhato malaṃ.

- 不誦經典穢，不勤為家穢，懶惰為色穢，放逸護衛穢。

##### 242

Malitthiyā duccaritaṃ, maccheraṃ dadato malaṃ, malā ve pāpakā dhammā, asmiṃ loke paramhi ca.

- 邪行婦人穢，吝嗇施者穢，此界及他界，惡法實為穢。
- Bad conduct is the impurity of a woman, miserliness is the impurity of one giving, evil characteristics are impurities indeed in this world and the next.

##### 243

Tato malā malataraṃ, avijjā paramaṃ malaṃ, etaṃ malaṃ pahantvāna, nimmalā hotha bhikkhavo.

- 此等諸垢中，無明垢為最，汝當除此垢，成無垢比丘。
- There is a greater impurity than this impurity. Ignorance is the greatest impurity. Giving up this impurity, be free from impurities, o bhikkhus.

Sujīvaṃ ahirikena, kākasūrena dhaṃsinā, pakkhandinā pagabbhena, saṃkiliṭṭhena jīvitaṃ.

- 生活無慚愧，鹵莽如烏鴉，詆毀於他人，大膽自誇張，傲慢邪惡者，其人生活易。

##### 245

Hirīmatā ca dujjīvaṃ, niccaṃ sucigavesinā, alīnenāppagabbhena, suddhājīvena passatā.

- 生活於慚愧，常求於清淨，不著欲謙遜，住清淨生活，富於識見者，其人生活難。

##### 246

Yo pāṇam-atipāteti, musāvādañca bhāsati, loke adinnam-ādiyati, paradārañca gacchati,

Evaṃ bho purisa jānāhi, pāpadhammā asaññatā, mā taṃ lobho adhammo ca, ciraṃ dukkhāya randhayuṃ.

- 如是汝應知，不制則為惡，莫貪與非法，自陷於永苦。
- Thus know, o man, that evil characteristics are uncontrolled. May lust and the unlawful not deliver you over to misery for a long time.

Dadāti ve yathāsaddhaṃ, yathāpasādanaṃ jano, tattha yo maṅku bhavati, paresaṃ pānabhojane, na so divā vā rattiṃ vā, samādhim-adhigacchati.

- 若信樂故施，心嫉他得食，彼於晝或夜，不得入三昧。
- Men give indeed according to their faith and according to their inclination. In this matter one who is upset about the food and drink (given) to others does not attain concentration by day or by night.

Sudassaṃ vajjam-aññesaṃ, attano pana duddasaṃ, paresaṃ hi so vajjāni, opunāti yathā bhusaṃ, attano pana chādeti, kaliṃ va kitavā saṭho.

- 易見他人過，自見則為難，揚惡如揚糠，己過則覆匿，如彼狡博者，隱匿其格利。

Ākāse va padaṃ natthi, samaṇo natthi bāhire, papañcābhiratā pajā, nippapañcā tathāgatā.

- 虛空無道跡，外道無沙門，眾生喜虛妄，如來無虛妄。
