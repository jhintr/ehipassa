- The Fool

##### 60

Dīghā jāgarato ratti, dīghaṃ santassa yojanaṃ, dīgho bālānaṃ saṃsāro, saddhammaṃ avijānataṃ.

- 不眠者夜長，倦者由旬長，不明達正法，愚者輪回長。
- Long is the night for one who is awake. Long is a yojana for one who is weary. Long is journeying-on for fools who do not know the true doctrine.

##### 61

Carañce nādhigaccheyya, seyyaṃ sadisam-attano, ekacariyaṃ daḷhaṃ kayirā, natthi bāle sahāyatā.

- 不得勝我者為友，與我相等者亦無，寧可堅決獨行居，不與愚人作伴侶。
- If when wandering one does not meet one's better or one's equal, one should certainly make a solitary journey. There is no companionship with fools.

##### 62

“Puttā matthi dhanaṃ matthi”, iti bālo vihaññati, attā hi attano natthi, kuto puttā kuto dhanaṃ?

- 「此我子我財」，愚人常為憂，我且無有我，何有子與財？
- (Thinking) “I have sons, I have wealth”, the fool is tormented. He has indeed no self of his own, how much less sons? How much less wealth?

---

##### 63

Yo bālo maññati bālyaṃ, paṇḍito vāpi tena so, bālo ca paṇḍitamānī, sa ve “bālo” ti vuccati.

- 愚者自知愚，彼即是智人，愚人自謂智，實稱真愚夫。
- Whatever fool realises his folly, he is on that account a learned man indeed. But a fool thinking he is learned, he indeed is called “fool”.

---

##### 64

Yāvajīvam pi ce bālo, paṇḍitaṃ payirupāsati, na so dhammaṃ vijānāti, dabbī sūparasaṃ yathā.

- 愚者雖終身，親近於智人，彼不了達摩，如匙嘗湯味。
- Even if a fool associates with a learned man all his life, he does not know the doctrine, just as a spoon does not know the taste of soup.

##### 65

Muhuttam-api ce viññū, paṇḍitaṃ payirupāsati, khippaṃ dhammaṃ vijānāti, jivhā sūparasaṃ yathā.

- 慧者須臾頃，親近於智人，能速解達摩，如舌嘗湯味。
- If a wise man associates with a learned man even for a moment, he quickly knows the doctrine, just as the tongue knows the taste of soup.

---

##### 66

Caranti bālā dummedhā, amitteneva attanā, karontā pāpakaṃ kammaṃ, yaṃ hoti kaṭukapphalaṃ.

- 愚人不覺知，與自仇敵行，造作諸惡業，受定眾苦果。
- Stupid fools wander about with a self which is like an enemy, doing evil action which has bitter fruit.

---

##### 67

Na taṃ kammaṃ kataṃ sādhu, yaṃ katvā anutappati, yassa assumukho rodaṃ, vipākaṃ paṭisevati.

- 彼作不善業，作已生後悔，哭泣淚滿面，應得受異熟。
- That deed when done is not good which one regrets when one has done it, the result of which one experiences weeping with tearful face.

##### 68

Tañca kammaṃ kataṃ sādhu, yaṃ katvā nānutappati, yassa patīto sumano, vipākaṃ paṭisevati.

- 若彼作善業，作已不追悔，歡喜而愉悅，應得受異熟。
- But that deed when done is good which one does not regret when one has done it, the result of which one experiences pleased and happy.

---

##### 69

Madhuvā maññati bālo, yāva pāpaṃ na paccati, yadā ca paccati pāpaṃ, atha dukkhaṃ nigacchati.

- 惡業未成熟，愚人思如蜜，惡業成熟時，愚人必受苦。
- A fool thinks it is like honey, as long as evil does not mature. But when evil matures, then the fool goes to misery.

---

##### 70

Māse māse kusaggena, bālo bhuñjeyya bhojanaṃ, na so saṅkhātadhammānaṃ, kalaṃ agghati soḷasiṃ.

- 愚者月復月，雖僅取少食，以孤沙草端，彼所得功德，不及思法者，十六分之一。
- A fool might eat his food month by month with the tip of kusa grass, he is not worth one sixteenth part of those who have perfected the doctrine.

---

##### 71

Na hi pāpaṃ kataṃ kammaṃ, sajju khīraṃ va muccati, ḍahantaṃ bālam-anveti, bhasmacchanno va pāvako.

- 猶如構牛乳，醍醐非速成，愚人造惡業，不即感惡果，業力隨其後，如死灰覆火。
- For an evil deed when done does not curdle the same day, as milk does. Burning like fire covered in ashes, it follows the fool.

---

##### 72

Yāvad-eva anatthāya, ñattaṃ bālassa jāyati, hanti bālassa sukkaṃsaṃ, muddham-assa vipātayaṃ.

- 愚夫求知識，反而趨滅亡，損害其幸福，破碎其頭首。
- A reputation for skill arises for a fool merely to his disadvantage, it destroys the fool's good share (of merit), splitting his head.

---

##### 73

Asantaṃ bhāvanam-iccheyya, purekkhārañca bhikkhusu, āvāsesu ca issariyaṃ, pūjā parakulesu ca.

- 愚人騖虛名，僧中作上座，僧院為院主，他人求供養。
- He might wish for respect from bad people, and pre-eminence among bhikkhus, and authority in dwelling places, and honours among the families of others.

##### 74

“Mam-eva kata maññantu, gihī pabbajitā ubho, mam-evātivasā assu, kiccākiccesu kismici”, iti bālassa saṅkappo, icchā māno ca vaḍḍhati.

- 「僧與俗共知，此事由我作，事無論大小，皆由我作主」，愚人作此想，貪與慢增長。
- “Let both householders and wanderers know that this was done by me. Let them be under my control alone in anything concerning what is to be done and not done.” Such is the fool's thought. His desire and his pride increase.

##### 75

Aññā hi lābhūpanisā, aññā nibbānagāminī, evam-etaṃ abhiññāya, bhikkhu buddhassa sāvako, sakkāraṃ nābhinandeyya, vivekam-anubrūhaye.

- 一道引世利，一道向涅槃，佛弟子比丘，當如是了知，莫貪著世利，專注於遠離。
- There is one means for getting gain, another means for going to nibbāna. Thus having learned this, let the bhikkhu, the follower of the Buddha, not rejoice in honour. Let him practise seclusion.
